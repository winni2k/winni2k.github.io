I am a post-doctoral researcher in [Olof Emanuelsson's group](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/olof-emanuelsson/) at the [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) where I develop statistical methods for transcriptome assembly and allele-specific expression in Norway spruce.

My PhD work in the [Marchini Group](https://jmarchini.org/) at the University of Oxford focused on creating statistical methods for haplotype phasing and genotype imputation that scale well with sample size.  I also applied these methods to large human sequencing projects such as the [CONVERGE](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/converge) and [Haplotype Reference](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) consortia.
