title: The cortexpy docs are out
---

The [documentation](https://cortexpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for [cortexpy](https://pypi.org/project/cortexpy/) is now available on the excellent technical documentation site [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org). The docs also contain [a description](https://cortexpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/main.html) of the link-informed graph traversal that [abeona](https://github.com/winni2k/abeona) uses to create candidate transcripts.

The documentation still needs a lot of work, but I am excited to announce this first step.
