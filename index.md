I am a post-doctoral researcher in [Sten Eirik Jacobsen's](https://ki.se/en/medh/sten-eirik-w-jacobsen-lab-hematopoietic-stem-cell-biology-group) 
group at the Karolinska Institute where I develop statistical methods to investigate hematopoiesis through phylogenetic inference.

Previously, I worked with [Olof Emanuelsson](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/olof-emanuelsson/)
at the SciLifeLab on methods for transcriptome
assembly in Norway spruce. My DPhil work in the [Marchini Group](https://jmarchini.org/)
at the University of Oxford focused on creating statistical methods for haplotype phasing and genotype imputation that scale well with sample size.  I also applied these methods to large human sequencing projects such as the [CONVERGE](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/converge) and [Haplotype Reference](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) consortia.

In my spare time I sing with [Stockholms Students√•ngare](http://sssf.se/) and orienteer with Stockholm's [Centrum OK](http://www.centrumok.se/).
