I am a principal scientist in the Analysis team at Vanadis Diagnostics, a PerkinElmer company. At Vanadis my focus is the development of algorithms for the analysis of data produced by the [Vanadis NIPT system](https://www.perkinelmer.com/uk/category/vanadis-nipt-system).

I previously developed statistical methods to investigate hematopoiesis through phylogenetic inference in [Sten Eirik Jacobsen's lab](https://ki.se/en/medh/sten-eirik-w-jacobsen-lab-hematopoietic-stem-cell-biology-group) at the Karolinska Institute. 
Before that I worked with [Olof Emanuelsson](https://www.scilifelab.se/researchers/olof-emanuelsson/)
at the SciLifeLab on methods for transcriptome
assembly in Norway spruce. My DPhil work in the [Marchini Group](https://jmarchini.org/)
at the University of Oxford focused on creating statistical methods for haplotype phasing and genotype imputation that scale well with sample size.  I also applied these methods to large human sequencing projects such as the [CONVERGE](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/converge) and [Haplotype Reference](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) consortia.

In my spare time I sing with [Stockholms Students√•ngare](http://sssf.se/) and orienteer with Stockholm's [Centrum OK](http://www.centrumok.se/).
